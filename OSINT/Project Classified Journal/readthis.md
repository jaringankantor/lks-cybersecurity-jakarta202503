# PROJECT CLASSIFIED JOURNAL

### Situation:
A rogue academic operating under the alias *dodofold* managed to slip through official channels years ago, publishing a critical manuscript without institutional approval.
To secure his authorship without exposure, he encrypted his work behind a traceable alphanumeric code — a unique fingerprint assigned to his paper at the moment of release.

This sequence still exists today, quietly tucked away inside open repositories and scholarly archives.
It is his first academic footprint — and your mission is to locate it.

This code is critical:

It confirms dodofold's earliest known publication.
It links him to his original academic identity.

### Intel Packet:
The work is self-published via a less **conventional scholarly platform** — not a major university press.

The title involves profiling, security, social media.

The timestamp: somewhere between 2017 and 2021.

Fragmentary leaks mention an identifier starting with *two digit number* and followed by *period"* symbol, but the full sequence remains concealed.

### Objective:
Recover the unique fingerprint assigned to dodofold’s original paper.

Submit the full identifier inside the flag format:

`LKSSMKJAKUT{full_identifier}`
