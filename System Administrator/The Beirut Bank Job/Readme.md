## The Beirut Bank Job

**Oh great, another README file...**

This one's supposedly about something called The Beirut Bank Job.

I mean, seriously, who reads these anyway?

- Just figure it out yourselfâ€”make sure to use `grep`!
- If you're really desperate, people say "read the documentation" or something.

> As if that's ever helpful...

Anyway, it's just another annoying **CTF challenge**.
